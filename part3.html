        <h1 class="comic-title">Shakti: The Eternal Guardian</h1>
        <p class="comic-intro">The shadow of the final eclipse falls over Mumbai. The Dark Alliance’s plan to summon the ultimate force of destruction is nearly complete. Shakti stands on the edge of the greatest challenge he has ever faced, knowing that his choices now will shape the future of the world. But this time, it’s not just about power—it’s about legacy, sacrifice, and what it truly means to be a guardian.</p>

            <p>Shakti feels the weight of destiny upon him as he remembers the ancient prophecy. The eclipse draws near, and the final confrontation with the Dark Alliance is inevitable. As he seeks answers from the elements, a vision reveals the full scope of the prophecy: to save the world, Shakti must sacrifice something precious. The choice is laid bare before him—his power or his soul.</p>
            <p>But the vision offers one final revelation: this battle will not just end a war. It will define Shakti’s legacy, the story that will be told for generations.</p>

            <p>As the day of the eclipse approaches, chaos erupts in the streets of Mumbai. The Dark Alliance has unleashed the full power of the void, and their leader—now imbued with dark energy—stands ready to end everything. Shakti races through the streets, protecting the people, but for every enemy he defeats, another appears. The city teeters on the brink of annihilation.</p>
            <p>The moon moves to block out the sun completely, casting an eerie, blood-red glow over the city. Shakti knows that the final battle has arrived. The prophecy repeats in his mind, and he steels himself for the decision he must make.</p>

            <p>At the height of the eclipse, Dev returns, pulling Shakti back from the brink of despair. Trapped in the void for years, Dev has learned the secrets of the dark forces, and together with Shakti, they form a plan to defeat the leader of the Dark Alliance once and for all.</p>
            <p>But as they prepare for the final fight, Dev warns Shakti: "The void will consume whatever it touches. To close the portal, you’ll need more than elemental power—you’ll need to make the greatest sacrifice." Shakti nods. He understands. The price for victory has always been clear.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: The Final Sacrifice</h2>
            <img src="A_dramatic_comic_book-style_image_of_Shakti_standi.png" alt="Shakti battling the leader of the Dark Alliance.">
            <p>The final battle is fought on the rooftops of Mumbai as the world hangs in the balance. Shakti and Dev face the leader of the Dark Alliance, whose power is drawn from the eclipse itself. The two brothers fight side by side, using the combined strength of the elements and void magic. The sky crackles with energy, and the city below trembles as elemental forces clash with the dark magic of the void.</p>
            <p>As the eclipse reaches its peak, Shakti realizes the truth: the only way to stop the void from consuming the world is to sacrifice not just his powers—but his life. The prophecy had always been about him, about the role he was destined to play as the Guardian of the Elements.</p>
            <p>In the final, heart-wrenching moment, Shakti makes his choice. He steps into the void, channeling all of his elemental power into one final act of defiance. The energy ripples through the city as the void collapses, the darkness receding with it.</p>
            <p>Shakti’s last words to Dev echo in the silence: "Tell them I did it for them."</p>

            <img src="A_comic_book-style_image_of_Dev_standing_on_a_roof.png" alt="Dev overlooking Mumbai at dawn.">
            <p>The eclipse ends, the sky clears, and the void is sealed forever. The Dark Alliance is defeated, and the world is saved. But Shakti is gone, having sacrificed his life to save the city—and the world.</p>
            <p>In the days that follow, the people of Mumbai begin to understand what has happened. They remember the Guardian of the Elements who fought for them, who protected them, and who gave everything for their safety. Statues are erected in Shakti’s honor, and his story is passed down from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>Dev, now a guardian of his own, watches over the city from the shadows, ensuring that Shakti’s sacrifice was not in vain. He knows that while his brother may be gone, Shakti’s spirit lives on in the elements, forever protecting the world.</p>

            <img src="A_comic_book-style_image_of_a_grand_statue_of_Shak.png" alt="A grand statue of Shakti standing in a plaza in Mumbai.">
            <p>Years later, on the anniversary of the eclipse, the people of Mumbai gather around the statue of Shakti. They tell stories of the brave Guardian who fought the darkness and won. Children play in the square, their laughter a symbol of the peace Shakti brought.</p>
            <p>Above them, the sky is clear, but the elements stir—wind rustling through the trees, water flowing gently, and the earth steady beneath their feet. Shakti’s presence is felt everywhere.</p>
            <p>And as the world moves forward, Shakti’s name is never forgotten. His story is not just one of power or heroism, but of sacrifice, legacy, and love for the people he protected. He is, and will always be, <strong>The Eternal Guardian</strong>.</p>
